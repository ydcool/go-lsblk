# go-lsblk

## Project Overview

The project aims to provide a convenient way to list block device information in a system. By using Go language files
`lsblk.go` and `lsblk_linux.go`, the project implements functionality to retrieve and display block device information.
Additionally, the project's root directory includes a `README.md` file, which likely provides an overall introduction,
usage instructions, and other relevant information about the project.

## Core Features

### List Block Devices

The main feature is to list the block devices in the system through Go language code. For example,
the [main.go](example/main.go) file in the [example](example) directory showcases a sample program that calls
the `go-lsblk`
library to fetch and
print
block device information.
